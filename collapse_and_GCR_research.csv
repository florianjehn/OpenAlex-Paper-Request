Toon; Alan Robock,,False,closed,,"Abstract This chapter discusses the history of efforts to lessen the threat of nuclear war, including treaties to limit testing, treaties to ban nuclear weapons from certain places (like the Southern Hemisphere and space), and the awarding of Nobel Peace Prizes for these efforts. Many have argued that nuclear war has been deterred since World War II by the threat of mutual assured destruction from nuclear weapons. However, notable defense experts and politicians have argued that mutual assured destruction is a flawed concept and that we have just been lucky to have avoided nuclear conflict. Nuclear winter shows that launching a nuclear first strike is a form of suicide, self-assured destruction. How can we avoid nuclear war? What can you, both individually and collectively, do so that we don’t end up like the dinosaurs?",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life; European and Russian Geopolitical Military Strategies

In a nuclear winter, multiyear subfreezing temperatures occur at midlatitudes. Agriculture will fail under these conditions. Even a limited nuclear war or a regional conflict such as between India and Pakistan could result in enough cooling to damage many crops. We only maintain a few months of food in storage, so worldwide starvation would occur if agriculture were significantly damaged. We show in each country how many people would not survive various scenarios resulting from a war between India and Pakistan. We also discuss the potential of nuclear winter resulting from a war between the United States and Russia. Ten times more people could die in nations far removed from the conflict than would die from the direct, horrific blasts, fires, and radiation in the target nations. One to 3 billion people might starve to death after a war between India and Pakistan, while more than 6 billion could starve in a nuclear winter.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life; Astronomical and nuclear sciences

Previous studies have suggested urban agriculture as a resilience measure in the context of climate change and other natural hazards. Aims To estimate the contribution a radical pivot to urban agriculture could have in building resilience to GCRs and the near-urban industrial agriculture needed to supplement urban food production. Methods We determined optimum crops through mathematical optimization for food calorie and protein supply per land area for both urban and near-urban (industrial) agriculture. We calculated the land area available for food production within a temperate globally median-sized city using Google Earth image analysis of residential lots and open city spaces. We calculated the population that could be fed through urban agriculture alone, and the extra near-urban land required for cropping with industrial agriculture to feed the remaining city population, under both normal climate, and potential nuclear winter conditions. Results The optimal crops for urban agriculture were peas (normal climate), and sugar beet/spinach (nuclear winter); while those optimal for industrial near-urban production were potatoes (normal climate), and wheat/carrots (nuclear winter). Urban agriculture could feed a fifth (20%) of the population. At least 1140 hectares of near-urban cultivation could make up the shortfall. Another 110 hectares of biofuel feedstock like canola (rapeseed) could provide biodiesel to run agricultural machinery without fuel trade. Significantly more cultivated area is needed in nuclear winter scenarios due to reduced yields. Conclusion Relatively little optimized near-urban industrial agriculture, along with intensified urban agriculture could feed a median-sized city in a GCR, while minimizing fuel requirements. Governments and municipal authorities could consider land use policy that encourages development of urban agriculture and near-urban cultivation of optimal crops, along with processing and local biofuel refining capacity.","Urban Agriculture and Sustainability; Environmental, Ecological, and Cultural Studies"

This book explores these parallels. Part I of the book tells how the dinosaurs died, how other collisions threaten us, and how we can stop another impact. Part II describes how a nuclear war might produce fatalities across Earth, even outside combat zones, from mechanisms like those that killed the dinosaurs. The military ignores this danger.

Everest hit what is now the Yucatan Peninsula at a speed ten times faster than the fastest rifle bullet. Debris from the impact blew into space, re-entered the atmosphere as a swarm of shooting stars that burned the global forests and grasslands, leaving behind a thin global layer containing rock from the asteroid and from Mexico and smoke from the fires. This layer marks one of the greatest extinctions in Earth history, including not just dinosaurs but also fish, plankton, ammonites, and plants making up about 75% of the known species. The major culprits in these extinctions are loss of sunlight due to absorption by the smoke and decade-long Ice Age temperatures. A nuclear war with just a few hundred of the world’s 12,000 nuclear weapons targeted on densely populated cities could plunge Earth into the same types of conditions that the dinosaurs experienced. Even a war between India and Pakistan could kill 1 to 3 billion people from starvation due to agricultural failure, while 6 billion people might starve following a war involving Russia, NATO, and the United States. This book describes how the dinosaurs died and how their deaths parallel what might happen to people after a nuclear war.

Understanding the damage magnitude and preparing for the folly of its occurrence is critical given current geopolitical tensions. We developed and applied a framework to simulate global crop production under a nuclear winter using the Cycles agroecosystem model, incorporating UV-B radiation effects on plant growth and adaptive selection of crop maturity types (shorter cycle the lower the temperature). Using maize ( Zea maize L.) as a sentinel crop, we found that annual maize production could decline from 7% after a small-scale regional nuclear war with 5 Tg soot injection, to 80% after a global nuclear war with 150 Tg soot injection, with recovery taking from 7 to 12 years. UV-B damage would peak 6–8 years post-war and can further decrease annual maize production by 7%. Over the recovery period, adaptive selection of maize maturity types to track changing temperatures could increase production by 10% compared to a no-adaptation strategy. Seed availability may become a critical adaptation bottleneck. We propose that adaptation must include the development of Agricultural Resilience Kits, consisting of region- and climate-specific seed and technology packages designed to buffer against uncertainty while supply chains recover. This kit, congenial with the transient conditions during the recovery period, would also be applicable to other catastrophes affecting food production.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Radioactive contamination and transfer

Therefore, it is essential to keep such critical infrastructure safe from disasters. However, existing risk assessment studies often assume relatively stable climate conditions. Abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios, such as those caused by a nuclear war, a large volcanic eruption, or an asteroid impact, could cool the planet by up to 10°C and thus frost-damage water pipes. This study investigates such vulnerability of the global underground water supply network in urban areas, in a nuclear winter – one such abrupt climate shift resulting from a nuclear war. We use climate modeling data simulating a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States of America, in combination with predictions of the network location and density derived from nighttime light and artificial impervious surface data. By considering an increase in maximum frost depth under nuclear winter conditions, we identify areas where such networks are most vulnerable to disruption, and predict the length of the potentially affected pipelines using population-size-based and street-network-length-based models. As estimated, a total of ~5–9 million kilometers of this critical infrastructure in 92 countries is at risk of freezing, potentially impacting the primary water source of over 2 billion individuals. Our findings highlight the need to expand the scope of climate resilience assessments in water risk research to include a broader range of climate scenarios, including sudden cold shifts.",Radioactive contamination and transfer; Nuclear Issues and Defense

To investigate how thoughts about human extinction affect terror management, participants were presented with either an apocalyptic, destructive, or neutral video in combination with a manipulation of MS. Participants reported highest death-thought accessibility when watching the apocalyptic video under MS. However, worldview defense was decreased after watching the apocalyptic video under MS.

Qualitative data were subjected to a meta-synthesis consisting of three levels of analysis. 38 evidence reviews were included. Analysis identified recurring characteristics of community resilience. Six studies reported 10 abilities required for community resilience including: adapt, transform, absorb, anticipate, prepare, prevent, self-organise, include, connect and cope. 25 studies reported 11 types of resources: social, economic, environmental, governance, physical infrastructure, institutional, communication, human capital, health, emergency management and socioeconomic. 21 components have been identified that can be used as a basis for operationalising and measuring community resilience. In contexts of disaster management, community resilience is a fairly mature concept that reflects a community's inherent capacity/abilities to withstand and recover from shocks. There is a need to incorporate a 'resource' perspective that speaks to a wider enabling environment.

Total vulnerable pipe length is expected to be 5.4-8.8 million km affecting over 2 billion people, with peak freeze depths exceeding 30 m. In several assessed scenarios, soil piling is expected to take 113-141 days and leave 0.32-0.64 million km of pipelines damaged, affecting 161 million people. Heat cables could be installed where soil piling is impractical, such as where pipes are beneath critical roads, but heat cable production is expected to be sufficient for less than 1% of vulnerable pipes.

We describe the ways in which economic warfare is waged, which include tariffs, trade sanctions, currency manipulation, and cyberattacks, and the health consequences that arise from them. Drawing on historical examples like the Opium Wars, we highlight the intertwined nature of economic and military conflicts. We also describe how advances in technology have created new opportunities, such as the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT payment system. The health consequences are profound, with research indicating declines in life expectancy and disruptions in access to essential medicines and equipment. We argue for a comprehensive public health response, made urgent by the rejection, by the current U.S. administration, of the post‐war international order.
