Here, we examine a new conceptual framework for social work in a time of societal collapse as a potential adaptation. Unlike conventional social work models, this does not have the premise of a resumption of status quo systems but, in fact, reflects the unfortunate likelihood of the continued worsening of climate impacts on social systems. It develops a theoretical framework of ‘collapsed social work’ based on case studies of how social work currently operates and develops in collapsed situations. It illustrates how a flattened hierarchical framework, egalitarian principles and mutual aid dynamics come together in these times. It demonstrates that this is not only something that occurs organically but also something that we can actively create as social workers in practice as a pre-emptive plan for the future. Finally, we use scenario analysis to posit potential illustrative examples of its use. The article ultimately serves to question how social work might be reimagined and if it will even continue to survive at all.",Social Work Education and Practice; Homelessness and Social Issues; Criminal Justice and Corrections Analysis

Based on the Social Amplification of Risk Framework (SARF), this study conducts an online survey in China (N = 908) and constructs a moderated mediation model. Using bootstrapped moderated mediation analysis, this study examines the relationships among social media exposure to pandemic information, risk perception, source credibility, and public engagement on social media at the early stages of the pandemic. The results demonstrate a positive relationship between social media exposure and public engagement, which can be mediated by risk perception. The relationship between social media exposure and public engagement via risk perception is moderated by source credibility. The higher perceived credibility of official and interpersonal sources undermines risk perception, but also hinders public engagement in the crisis. The moderating effect of professional source credibility is not significant. This study has expanded the SARF and has contributed to promoting risk communication strategies from the perspective of risk information processing.",Public Relations and Crisis Communication; Misinformation and Its Impacts; Risk Perception and Management

In this article I will treat this crisis as a diagnostic event to identify two significant interinstitutional dynamics that drove Nikita Khrushchev and President John F. Kennedy to this rationality-defying precipice. The first of these dynamics explores the consequences of transitioning military units from peacetime routines to crisis-level field deployment, which quickly created considerable command-and-control problems for both political leaders. Yet each believed that the other side remained in control of its forces, erroneously understanding local action by the other side as strategic moves ordered by central command. This created the potential for uncontrollable escalation. The second dynamic resulted from the interaction of two institutional arrangements in the United States. American presidents are simultaneously the country’s highest decision makers in foreign affairs and political campaigners interested in their own reelection. Foreign policy decisions thus become potential campaign moves. After World War II, a campaigning tradition emerged in which both parties felt compelled to outdo each other with anticommunist rhetoric and policies. This strategy built on deeply instituted anticommunism in the electorate, which politicians felt compelled to further cultivate. This dynamic significantly limited Kennedy’s response options, making it more likely than not that he would have called for an invasion of Cuba if Khrushchev had not backed down. The consequences would have been disastrous. The article concludes with tentative lessons to learn from these two dynamics.",International Relations and Foreign Policy; Nuclear Issues and Defense; Whitehead's Philosophy and Applications

Two critical factors that remain underexplored are the soldier’s willingness to sacrifice for their country and a country’s willingness to risk nuclear war. To address this gap, we conducted a worldwide survey to assess the maximum acceptable level of losses respondents would tolerate in their own country for varying levels of enemy losses. The findings were surprising: respondents, on average, considered 23% casualties (with a median of 10%) as an acceptable loss if it meant 100% destruction of the enemy. To determine which nuclear power might be more inclined to initiate a nuclear war, we introduce the willingness to risk ratio, defined as the ratio between the GDP that can be destroyed in enemy countries and the GDP that could be destroyed by the enemy in one’s own country. Recognizing that conventional wars can serve as a pretext for a nuclear conflict between two nuclear powers, S and S′, we developed a network model where bravery is defined at the micro level of individual soldiers, whereas defeatism can spread contagiously throughout the network. If due to increasing aid of the nuclear power S′ to a weaker country W, the opposing nuclear power S suffers heavier casualties, the probability of the nuclear catastrophe P surges, prompting S and S′ to start weighing between a nuclear-war scenario and continuation of the proxy war. In this case, the increase of P ramps up the chance that the power S′, geographically farther to the spot of conflict, stops supporting W since it is less willing to risk nuclear war and in economic terms, S′ may lose more than S if the war escalates.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Military Strategy and Technology; European and Russian Geopolitical Military Strategies

Its findings suggest humanity suffers an emergency condition by the objective existential threat of nuclear war. The Liberal International Order has not addressed this existential (in)security, prioritising liberal internationalism and the maintenance of the nuclear order. Current prospects of a severe NATO-Russia war, a Sino-American conflict or an uncontained iteration of either, could warp into a systemic war leading to mutual extermination, fatally unravelling the legitimacy of the US-led world order, its reliance on national security, collective defence, and deterrence practice. If existential security is imperilled by the risk of nuclear war – explicitly – why does the recognition of this threat not warrant a re-ordering of the LIO? The dangerous routine of nuclearism provides states with ontological security internationally, which undermines the liberal or decent self-identity, domestically. A reordering of the international system offers one escape from these contradictions. This would involve a restoration of great power relations in a ‘common security’ arrangement.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Global Security and Public Health; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life

Daddis,,False,closed,,"Abstract This chapter reflects on President Reagan’s evolving stance toward war and nuclear arms during his second term. Initially, Reagan's rhetoric portrayed the Soviet Union as an “evil empire,"" aligning military strength with freedom, yet concerns over nuclear escalation began to shape his thinking. By the mid-1980s, he had started emphasizing diplomacy and arms control, proposing the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) to avoid the destructive consequences of nuclear war. His efforts, however, met with skepticism from both allies and domestic critics, who doubted the feasibility of SDI and feared it would destabilize the global equilibrium. Nevertheless, Reagan pursued dialogue with Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, culminating in the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, which eliminated an entire class of nuclear weapons, signaling a shift in US-Soviet relations and raising broader questions about the future of war in a post-Cold War world.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; International Relations and Foreign Policy; Twentieth Century Scientific Developments

It critically contrasts this figure with Homo Technologicus, the dominant model of optimization, external control, and digital surveillance, arguing instead for a path grounded in inner governance, ethical responsibility, and posthuman wisdom. Drawing on a wide range of thinkers—Spinoza, Aristotle, Foucault, Zuboff, Harari, Le Guin—the article integrates speculative philosophy with critical theory, outlining a four-stage “spiral of meaning”: knowledge, responsibility, experience, and wisdom. In this model, wisdom is not a retreat from the world but a moral re-engagement with it. The article further incorporates a speculative parable—a Martian allegory—that allegorizes civilizational collapse under technocratic logic and the eventual emergence of a new ethics. Through metaphysical reflection and cultural critique, the figure of Homo Hecmateus becomes an ethical imperative rather than a utopian prophecy. The study aims to reposition philosophical anthropology within the context of digital capitalism, algorithmic governance, and planetary crisis. It advocates a normative transformation: not the optimization of intelligence, but the cultivation of orientation and meaning. Ultimately, the article calls for a new form of human becoming—where conscience, cognition, and action converge.",Theology and Philosophy of Evil
