For some of these catastrophes, island nations may have relative survival potential but any collapse in international trade could also end critical imported goods such as pharmaceuticals. We aimed to explore the latter using the case study country of Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Methods We identified the 10 most extensively prescribed pharmaceuticals in NZ that are used for acute treatment (by annual prescription numbers). Based on modern synthesis pathways for these pharmaceuticals in the literature, we identified ingredients and then determined if these ingredients were currently produced in NZ. Results The results suggest that none of these 10 pharmaceuticals could be produced in NZ in a trade-ending catastrophe: paracetamol, omeprazole, amoxicillin, ibuprofen, aspirin, metoprolol succinate, salbutamol, prednisone, cetirizine hydrochloride, and amlodipine. This is primarily because NZ does not refine petrochemicals. For seven of these 10 pharmaceuticals the relevant catalysts or other specific chemical ingredients are also not mined or otherwise produced in NZ. There may, however, be some scope for the post-catastrophe scavenging of minerals for producing some catalysts. Conclusions This preliminary analysis suggests that none of the 10 most extensively prescribed pharmaceuticals used for acute treatments could be manufactured in this case study country after a trade-ending global catastrophe. To address this and other domains lacking in resiliency (eg, liquid fuel supply), a research programme for building shared resiliency with other neighbouring nations (eg, Australia) could be considered.",Biotechnology and Related Fields; Economic Sanctions and International Relations

Previous studies have suggested urban agriculture as a resilience measure in the context of climate change and other natural hazards. Aims To estimate the contribution a radical pivot to urban agriculture could have in building resilience to GCRs and the near-urban industrial agriculture needed to supplement urban food production. Methods We determined optimum crops through mathematical optimization for food calorie and protein supply per land area for both urban and near-urban (industrial) agriculture. We calculated the land area available for food production within a temperate globally median-sized city using Google Earth image analysis of residential lots and open city spaces. We calculated the population that could be fed through urban agriculture alone, and the extra near-urban land required for cropping with industrial agriculture to feed the remaining city population, under both normal climate, and potential nuclear winter conditions. Results The optimal crops for urban agriculture were peas (normal climate), and sugar beet/spinach (nuclear winter); while those optimal for industrial near-urban production were potatoes (normal climate), and wheat/carrots (nuclear winter). Urban agriculture could feed a fifth (20%) of the population. At least 1140 hectares of near-urban cultivation could make up the shortfall. Another 110 hectares of biofuel feedstock like canola (rapeseed) could provide biodiesel to run agricultural machinery without fuel trade. Significantly more cultivated area is needed in nuclear winter scenarios due to reduced yields. Conclusion Relatively little optimized near-urban industrial agriculture, along with intensified urban agriculture could feed a median-sized city in a GCR, while minimizing fuel requirements. Governments and municipal authorities could consider land use policy that encourages development of urban agriculture and near-urban cultivation of optimal crops, along with processing and local biofuel refining capacity.",Urban Agriculture and Sustainability; Urban Green Space and Health

It addresses the critical gap in systematic quantifying resilience, with a particular focus on stakeholder interactions within urban communities. Design/methodology/approach The study proposes an integrated framework leveraging social network analysis (SNA) to map stakeholder interactions across three distinct phases. Network metrics are employed as evaluation indicators, while a hybrid evaluation model combining the coefficient of variation (COV) and the Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solutions (TOPSIS) is utilized to quantify resilience levels of urban communities. Findings Applying the framework to Community F in Xuzhou City revealed significant variations in social networks during the three phases, with the disaster response phase demonstrating the most intense interactions. Furthermore, the resilience levels exhibited a consistent downward trend across three phases. Originality/value This research provides a novel approach to disaster management and resilience by integrating SNA with hybrid evaluation models. It advances theoretical insights and provides practical strategies for enhancing urban community resilience, contributing to the reduction of urban vulnerabilities to disasters.",Disaster Management and Resilience; Infrastructure Resilience and Vulnerability Analysis; Flood Risk Assessment and Management

It reflects on two of the author's previous works that connect Bateson's ideas to broader ecological and systemic issues, critiquing the dominant dualistic thinking pervasive in Western societies. The paper considers the role of family therapists in addressing ecological crises, suggesting that systemic practitioners can foster environmental awareness and responsibility in families without coercion, through reflective, nondirective approaches. Drawing from posthumanist and deep ecology frameworks, the author parallels family systems with broader social structures, emphasising the interconnectedness between micro‐level family dynamics and macro‐level environmental systems. The paper also delves into Bateson's critique of power, Cartesian dualism and the hubristic thinking that contributes to both ecological and societal collapse. Ultimately, the paper calls for a shift in thinking towards a more holistic and humble understanding of humanity's place in the biosphere and encourages systemic therapists to integrate ecological considerations into both their professional and personal lives.",Climate Change Communication and Perception

Case studies provide compelling evidence of shortcomings in anticipatory measures and mitigation efforts by governments, particularly in safeguarding and protecting children. These inadequacies result in long-lasting harm, further compounded by factors such as conflicts, insecurity, deep-seated social divisions within nation states, and rampant corruption. Regrettably, governments often find themselves ill-prepared, leaving children to bear the brunt of the consequences. What exacerbates this issue is that the scale of these disasters frequently overwhelms international capacities, financial resources, and even political will. It is crucial that immediate action is taken to uphold and advance child rights in both peacetime and during conflicts. This demands a profound shift in global consciousness, requiring the kind of grassroots activism that has been witnessed in efforts to combat nuclear war, the proliferation of landmines, and, most recently, the battle against climate change.","Migration, Health and Trauma"

This paper builds on previous work assessing the extent of vulnerable water pipes in a severe ASRS, and assesses the feasibility of two methods of pipe protection: (i) piling soil above the pipes, and (ii) installing electrical resistive heat cables around pipes. Total vulnerable pipe length is expected to be 5.4-8.8 million km affecting over 2 billion people, with peak freeze depths exceeding 30 m. In several assessed scenarios, soil piling is expected to take 113-141 days and leave 0.32-0.64 million km of pipelines damaged, affecting 161 million people. Heat cables could be installed where soil piling is impractical, such as where pipes are beneath critical roads, but heat cable production is expected to be sufficient for less than 1% of vulnerable pipes. Implications for local, national, and international response planning are discussed, and potential directions for future research are identified, including improved quantification of the extent of subterranean infrastructure, analysis of direct damage from an ASRS-causing event, and exploration of alternative infrastructure protection methods.",Water Systems and Optimization; Underground infrastructure and sustainability

This study examines the relationship between perceived risk, resilience, and destination choice, focusing on the extent to which political and social conditions influence travel intentions. Using the social amplification of risk framework (SARF) and a quantitative survey, this research identifies key determinants of tourism resilience and risk perception management. Our findings indicate that political instability, safety concerns, and negative media coverage deter travelers, while effective crisis communication, strong governance, and high-quality public services can enhance a destination’s appeal. Based on these findings, the study recommends that destination marketers and tourism policymakers invest in targeted safety communication, service quality improvements, and strategies that address the specific concerns of more risk-sensitive demographics, such as women. The study offers strategic insights for destination marketers, tourism policymakers, and hospitality stakeholders on how to mitigate perceived risks and foster resilience in tourism-dependent economies. Future research could explore cross-cultural traveler behavior and incorporate perspectives from tourism professionals to further inform resilience strategies. By addressing these challenges, destinations can develop sustainable strategies to navigate crises and maintain competitiveness in an unpredictable global landscape.",Diverse Aspects of Tourism Research; Sport and Mega-Event Impacts; Culinary Culture and Tourism

The injected aerosols would reduce solar radiation, lower temperatures, and alter precipitation, impacting crop productivity, including for locally adapted traditional crop varieties, i.e. landraces. We assess post-catastrophic climate effects on crops with extensive landrace cultivation, barley, maize, rice, and sorghum, under climate scenarios that differ in the quantity of soot injection. Using a crop growth model, we estimate environmental stress gradients and together with genomic markers apply gradient forest offset methods to predict post-catastrophic maladaptation in landraces over time. We find landraces are most maladapted where soot-induced climate shifts were strongest. Validating our approach, gradient forest models successfully capture a signal of maize landrace adaptation in common gardens across Mexico. We further use our gradient forest models to identify landrace varieties best matched to specific post-catastrophic conditions, indicating potential substitutions for agricultural resilience. The best substituted varieties require long migration distances, often across country borders, though countries with more climatic diversity have better within-country substitutions. Our findings highlight that a soot-producing catastrophe would drive global maladaptation in landraces and suggest current adaptive diversity is insufficient for agricultural resilience.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Radioactive contamination and transfer; Plant responses to elevated CO2

Nowadays, the post-war network of American alliances remains a key component of their international security policy, aimed at ensuring military superiority over existing and potential rivals on the Eurasian continent. At the same time, the U.S. approaches to alliance building in the Pacific had certain peculiarities from the very beginning. In order to better understand them, as well as to identify the general principles of U.S. regional policymaking, it seems appropriate to study the genesis of the so-called San Francisco system, a complex of military-political arrangements between the United States and Asian states that developed in the early years of the Cold War. The core of this system is a series of agreements between the United States and a number of regional actors, including Japan, the Philippines, Australia, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea, and Taiwan. The article examines the course of negotiations and the content of agreements between the United States and each of these countries. According to the author, these agreements can be roughly divided into ‘guarantee’ and ‘reinsurance’ treaties. The former can be exemplified by the triple Pacific Security Treaty engaging Australia and New Zealand, which provided the allies with U.S. guarantees in the event of resurging Japanese militarism; mutual security agreements with the Republic of Korea and Taiwan stand for the latter. By concluding them, the United States sought, on the one hand, to guarantee the security of the allies crucial for the ‘Roll-back of Communism’ strategy, and, on the other, to ensure against any reckless steps by their leaders, minimizing the risk of the U.S. involvement in a nuclear war with the ‘Communist bloc’. The image of a ‘wheel with a hub and spokes’ was used to describe the established structure of allied relations. This ‘geometry’ of the links within the Pacific Rim appeared to be quite stable and, as a result, the San Francisco system, which was initially ad hoc, continues to exist today, albeit in a somewhat modified form.",Island Studies and Pacific Affairs; Arctic and Russian Policy Studies

This could have catastrophic impacts on human nutrition, unless the food system can adapt. One possible answer is seaweed, where growth is projected to be less impacted (or even enhanced) by the climate shock; however, this requires seaweed to be cost-effective, which has not yet been assessed. Here, we estimate the economic viability of producing Gracilaria Tikvahiae seaweed under the climatic conditions of a severe 150 Tg nuclear winter, as a benchmark. To do this, we incorporate projected yields and estimated costs under either a capital-intensive or labor-intensive model, including drying, assuming sales only occur in the initial 7 years when food prices would be highest. Overall, we find that seaweed costs would range between $ 400 and 450/dry tonne for the lowest cost clusters, and could potentially be produced in significant quantities, up to 250 million tonnes annually. Given the rise in food prices expected post-disaster a scaleup in seaweed would likely be justified, and could support global nutrition, either via direct consumption or when used as animal feed.",Arctic and Russian Policy Studies
