Toon; Alan Robock,,False,closed,,"Abstract This chapter discusses the history of efforts to lessen the threat of nuclear war, including treaties to limit testing, treaties to ban nuclear weapons from certain places (like the Southern Hemisphere and space), and the awarding of Nobel Peace Prizes for these efforts. Many have argued that nuclear war has been deterred since World War II by the threat of mutual assured destruction from nuclear weapons. However, notable defense experts and politicians have argued that mutual assured destruction is a flawed concept and that we have just been lucky to have avoided nuclear conflict. Nuclear winter shows that launching a nuclear first strike is a form of suicide, self-assured destruction. How can we avoid nuclear war? What can you, both individually and collectively, do so that we don’t end up like the dinosaurs?",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life; European and Russian Geopolitical Military Strategies

In a nuclear winter, multiyear subfreezing temperatures occur at midlatitudes. Agriculture will fail under these conditions. Even a limited nuclear war or a regional conflict such as between India and Pakistan could result in enough cooling to damage many crops. We only maintain a few months of food in storage, so worldwide starvation would occur if agriculture were significantly damaged. We show in each country how many people would not survive various scenarios resulting from a war between India and Pakistan. We also discuss the potential of nuclear winter resulting from a war between the United States and Russia. Ten times more people could die in nations far removed from the conflict than would die from the direct, horrific blasts, fires, and radiation in the target nations. One to 3 billion people might starve to death after a war between India and Pakistan, while more than 6 billion could starve in a nuclear winter.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Space Science and Extraterrestrial Life; Astronomical and nuclear sciences

Previous studies have suggested urban agriculture as a resilience measure in the context of climate change and other natural hazards. Aims To estimate the contribution a radical pivot to urban agriculture could have in building resilience to GCRs and the near-urban industrial agriculture needed to supplement urban food production. Methods We determined optimum crops through mathematical optimization for food calorie and protein supply per land area for both urban and near-urban (industrial) agriculture. We calculated the land area available for food production within a temperate globally median-sized city using Google Earth image analysis of residential lots and open city spaces. We calculated the population that could be fed through urban agriculture alone, and the extra near-urban land required for cropping with industrial agriculture to feed the remaining city population, under both normal climate, and potential nuclear winter conditions. Results The optimal crops for urban agriculture were peas (normal climate), and sugar beet/spinach (nuclear winter); while those optimal for industrial near-urban production were potatoes (normal climate), and wheat/carrots (nuclear winter). Urban agriculture could feed a fifth (20%) of the population. At least 1140 hectares of near-urban cultivation could make up the shortfall. Another 110 hectares of biofuel feedstock like canola (rapeseed) could provide biodiesel to run agricultural machinery without fuel trade. Significantly more cultivated area is needed in nuclear winter scenarios due to reduced yields. Conclusion Relatively little optimized near-urban industrial agriculture, along with intensified urban agriculture could feed a median-sized city in a GCR, while minimizing fuel requirements. Governments and municipal authorities could consider land use policy that encourages development of urban agriculture and near-urban cultivation of optimal crops, along with processing and local biofuel refining capacity.","Urban Agriculture and Sustainability; Environmental, Ecological, and Cultural Studies"

This book explores these parallels. Part I of the book tells how the dinosaurs died, how other collisions threaten us, and how we can stop another impact. Part II describes how a nuclear war might produce fatalities across Earth, even outside combat zones, from mechanisms like those that killed the dinosaurs. The military ignores this danger.

Everest hit what is now the Yucatan Peninsula at a speed ten times faster than the fastest rifle bullet. Debris from the impact blew into space, re-entered the atmosphere as a swarm of shooting stars that burned the global forests and grasslands, leaving behind a thin global layer containing rock from the asteroid and from Mexico and smoke from the fires. This layer marks one of the greatest extinctions in Earth history, including not just dinosaurs but also fish, plankton, ammonites, and plants making up about 75% of the known species. The major culprits in these extinctions are loss of sunlight due to absorption by the smoke and decade-long Ice Age temperatures. A nuclear war with just a few hundred of the world’s 12,000 nuclear weapons targeted on densely populated cities could plunge Earth into the same types of conditions that the dinosaurs experienced. Even a war between India and Pakistan could kill 1 to 3 billion people from starvation due to agricultural failure, while 6 billion people might starve following a war involving Russia, NATO, and the United States. This book describes how the dinosaurs died and how their deaths parallel what might happen to people after a nuclear war.

Understanding the damage magnitude and preparing for the folly of its occurrence is critical given current geopolitical tensions. We developed and applied a framework to simulate global crop production under a nuclear winter using the Cycles agroecosystem model, incorporating UV-B radiation effects on plant growth and adaptive selection of crop maturity types (shorter cycle the lower the temperature). Using maize ( Zea maize L.) as a sentinel crop, we found that annual maize production could decline from 7% after a small-scale regional nuclear war with 5 Tg soot injection, to 80% after a global nuclear war with 150 Tg soot injection, with recovery taking from 7 to 12 years. UV-B damage would peak 6–8 years post-war and can further decrease annual maize production by 7%. Over the recovery period, adaptive selection of maize maturity types to track changing temperatures could increase production by 10% compared to a no-adaptation strategy. Seed availability may become a critical adaptation bottleneck. We propose that adaptation must include the development of Agricultural Resilience Kits, consisting of region- and climate-specific seed and technology packages designed to buffer against uncertainty while supply chains recover. This kit, congenial with the transient conditions during the recovery period, would also be applicable to other catastrophes affecting food production.",Nuclear Issues and Defense; Radioactive contamination and transfer

Therefore, it is essential to keep such critical infrastructure safe from disasters. However, existing risk assessment studies often assume relatively stable climate conditions. Abrupt sunlight reduction scenarios, such as those caused by a nuclear war, a large volcanic eruption, or an asteroid impact, could cool the planet by up to 10°C and thus frost-damage water pipes. This study investigates such vulnerability of the global underground water supply network in urban areas, in a nuclear winter – one such abrupt climate shift resulting from a nuclear war. We use climate modeling data simulating a nuclear exchange between Russia and the United States of America, in combination with predictions of the network location and density derived from nighttime light and artificial impervious surface data. By considering an increase in maximum frost depth under nuclear winter conditions, we identify areas where such networks are most vulnerable to disruption, and predict the length of the potentially affected pipelines using population-size-based and street-network-length-based models. As estimated, a total of ~5–9 million kilometers of this critical infrastructure in 92 countries is at risk of freezing, potentially impacting the primary water source of over 2 billion individuals. Our findings highlight the need to expand the scope of climate resilience assessments in water risk research to include a broader range of climate scenarios, including sudden cold shifts.",Radioactive contamination and transfer; Nuclear Issues and Defense

To investigate how thoughts about human extinction affect terror management, participants were presented with either an apocalyptic, destructive, or neutral video in combination with a manipulation of MS. Participants reported highest death-thought accessibility when watching the apocalyptic video under MS. However, worldview defense was decreased after watching the apocalyptic video under MS.

Data were extracted from included studies using a specially developed data extraction form. Qualitative data were subjected to a meta-synthesis consisting of three levels of analysis. 38 evidence reviews were included. Analysis identified recurring characteristics of community resilience. Six studies reported 10 abilities required for community resilience including: adapt, transform, absorb, anticipate, prepare, prevent, self-organise, include, connect and cope. 25 studies reported 11 types of resources: social, economic, environmental, governance, physical infrastructure, institutional, communication, human capital, health, emergency management and socioeconomic. 21 components have been identified that can be used as a basis for operationalising and measuring community resilience. In contexts of disaster management, community resilience is a fairly mature concept that reflects a community's inherent capacity/abilities to withstand and recover from shocks. There is a need to incorporate a 'resource' perspective that speaks to a wider enabling environment. There is scope to investigate whether the same set of components identified here has relevance in public health emergencies emanating from disease or human acts of aggression and to articulate resilience logics to critical endpoints for health emergency management.",Disaster Management and Resilience; Disaster Response and Management; Flood Risk Assessment and Management

Total vulnerable pipe length is expected to be 5.4-8.8 million km affecting over 2 billion people, with peak freeze depths exceeding 30 m. In several assessed scenarios, soil piling is expected to take 113-141 days and leave 0.32-0.64 million km of pipelines damaged, affecting 161 million people. Heat cables could be installed where soil piling is impractical, such as where pipes are beneath critical roads, but heat cable production is expected to be sufficient for less than 1% of vulnerable pipes.

We describe the ways in which economic warfare is waged, which include tariffs, trade sanctions, currency manipulation, and cyberattacks, and the health consequences that arise from them. Drawing on historical examples like the Opium Wars, we highlight the intertwined nature of economic and military conflicts. We also describe how advances in technology have created new opportunities, such as the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT payment system. The health consequences are profound, with research indicating declines in life expectancy and disruptions in access to essential medicines and equipment. We argue for a comprehensive public health response, made urgent by the rejection, by the current U.S. administration, of the post‐war international order. We call for use of innovative research methods to assess the health impacts of economic measures, drawing parallels with studies on the health effects of military conflicts and economic crises and advocacy for a proactive public health stance, akin to the efforts of organisations like the International Physicians for the Prevention of Nuclear War, to make visible the health consequences of economic warfare and help those who seek to hold governments accountable for their actions.",Employment and Welfare Studies; Global Health Care Issues; Health and Conflict Studies

These outbreaks have had negative impacts on poultry producers, trade, and wild bird populations. Risk governance frameworks for emerging infectious diseases such as HPAI encourage outbreak policies to be grounded in a variety of stakeholder perspectives and for there to be effective, transparent communication between all those involved. However, the COVID-19 pandemic exemplified how collaboration is not always easy to implement, leading to potentially sub-optimal outbreak response processes. To our best knowledge, there is limited to no current research assessing the stakeholder landscape and outbreak decision-making and response processes in the United Kingdom (UK) and United States of America (USA) for the recent HPAI outbreak. In this study, 20 key stakeholders involved in outbreak decision-making and response in the United Kingdom and United States were asked to provide their insights into the structure of stakeholder landscape, communication pathways, and challenges in decision-making and response implementation for their respective countries. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with participants from the United Kingdom and United States; participants included policy advisors, veterinarians, researchers, and poultry industry representatives all involved in HPAI outbreak processes in their country. From these interviews, stakeholder maps for all those involved in HPAI decision-making and response were created for the UK and USA. This study concluded that smallholders and backyard poultry owners need to be better represented in policy-industry communication pathways and that improved information sharing at the policy-science and policy-industry interfaces is essential to ensure an efficient outbreak response.",Animal Disease Management and Epidemiology; Influenza Virus Research Studies; Zoonotic diseases and public health

Affected by water resource constraints, the expansion of artificial oases, and excessive exploitation of groundwater, the rural areas in the middle reaches of the Heihe River Basin, the second largest inland river in the arid region of northwest China, are confronted with prominent contradictions in the human-land relationship and urgently need to enhance their ability to cope with risks. Based on the remote sensing data of land use and major socio-economic data, this study draws on the theory of landscape ecology to construct a disturbance-resistance-adaptability evaluation system. Taking Ganzhou District, a typical irrigated agricultural area, as a case study, the study uses the entropy weight method, resilience change rate, and obstacle degree model to analyze the rural resilience level and its changing characteristics from 1990 to 2020, identifies the key obstacle factors affecting the development of rural resilience, and proposes risk governance strategies accordingly. Main conclusions: (1) The overall rural resilience index is relatively low, showing significant spatial disparities. Towns with well-developed multifunctional agriculture, nature reserves, and ecological-cultural control lines have higher resilience indices. (2) The change rate of the rural resilience index demonstrates phase heterogeneity, generally undergoing a “relative stability-increase-decrease” process, and forming a differentiation pattern of “decrease in the north and increase in the south”. (3) Internal risks to rural resilience development in the Ganzhou District mainly stem from low economic efficiency, fragile ecological environment, and unstable landscape patterns, among which efficiency-dominant and landscape-stability obstacle factors have a broader impact scope, while habitat resistance-type obstacle factors are mainly concentrated in the western part and suburban areas. Enhancing the benefits of water and soil resource utilization, strengthening habitat resistance, and stabilizing landscape patterns are key strategies for current-stage rural resilience governance in the middle reaches of the Heihe River. This study aims to optimize the human-land relationship in the rural areas of the middle reaches of the Heihe River.","Hydropower, Displacement, Environmental Impact"

This study analyzes the characteristics of and differences in embodied carbon emissions in the Maritime Transport Industry of the BRICS countries from the perspectives of producer responsibility, consumer responsibility, and shared responsibility, based on a global value chain framework. Using non-competitive input–output data from the OECD and introducing a processing trade adjustment mechanism, the study calculates the carbon emissions of the five countries from 1995 to 2018. The empirical results show that under producer responsibility, carbon emissions in China and South Africa’s maritime transport sectors are mainly driven by exports, with production-side emissions significantly higher than consumption-side emissions. Under consumer responsibility, emissions in India and Brazil are driven by the demand for imported goods, reflecting their high reliance on external markets. In shared responsibility accounting, China’s cumulative carbon emissions account for 66.81% of the total emissions from the five countries, highlighting its central role in global supply chains. The study also finds that the differences in carbon emissions among the countries are mainly due to differences in economic structures, trade dependencies, and consumption patterns. Different responsibility accounting methods have a significant impact on carbon emissions, with export-oriented countries tending to weaken producer responsibility, while import-oriented countries seek to avoid consumer responsibility. The shared responsibility mechanism, through the dynamic allocation coefficient α, provides a practical approach to balancing efficiency and equity in global carbon governance.",Coastal and Marine Management; Climate Change Policy and Economics; Maritime Ports and Logistics

Building upon existing literature, a conceptual model is developed with five exogenous factors – “leadership commitment and support,” risk governance,” “risk awareness and communication,” “competency and resources,” and “performance review and rewards’ as antecedents of organizational risk culture and risk management performance as an endogenous factor. Using a descriptive research design and a comprehensive thirty-one-item scale, we collected primary data from Indian general insurance companies to validate the causal model of risk culture using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results indicate that ‘leadership commitment and support’ is the foremost determinant of risk culture, followed by competency and resources, risk governance, and risk awareness and communication. The analysis further reveals that risk culture strongly impacts the risk management performance in the Indian insurance sector. In addition to demonstrating empirical evidence, the study also provides the risk culture assessment tool to risk management practitioners from the insurance industry.",Insurance and Financial Risk Management; Risk Management in Financial Firms; Supply Chain Resilience and Risk Management

In recent years, financial markets have experienced frequent and significant fluctuations around the world, bringing unprecedented challenges to investors, especially in the prevention and control of systemic risks. Systemic risk, i.e. market risk, is the risk that affects all assets and cannot be completely eliminated by diversifying the investment. In order to deal with this kind of risk, based on the financial mathematical modeling method, this paper constructs a comprehensive risk control model for securities market investment, in order to help investors and regulators to manage risks more scientifically and effectively, and to improve the stability of investment and the rationality of return. In the aspect of systematic risk prediction, this paper introduces machine learning technology to construct a systematic risk model with stronger prediction ability. By selecting multiple risk factors such as market volatility (MVI), liquidity (LSI), linkage (MCI) and volume pressure (VPI), a multi-factor prediction model is established, which uses machine learning algorithms such as XGBoost and stochastic forest to predict the change trend of future systematic risk. During the training process, the model improves the ability to capture market risks through feature engineering and parameter optimization, so that it can more effectively predict the possible market fluctuations in the future. At the same time, this paper makes a feature importance analysis on the model, which helps to identify the factors that have a key impact on the systematic risk and provides further basis for the application and improvement of the model. On the whole, the model proposed in this paper has high practicability and algorithm efficiency while effectively controlling the risks, which provides a scientific basis for the risk control in the securities market.",Risk Management in Financial Firms

This paper examines the Central Limit Theorem (CLT) and Law of Large Numbers (LLN) in insurance, highlighting their complementary roles: CLT models loss distributions (e.g., approximating total risks as normal for capital reserve estimation) and LLN stabilizes long-term claims (e.g., balancing premium affordability and profitability through risk pooling). Empirical analyses across auto, health, and life insurance demonstrate CLT quantifying extreme payout probabilities (95% confidence intervals for catastrophic losses) and LLN optimizing premium structures via historical claims convergence. Copula theory extends traditional independence assumptions for correlated risks (e.g., regional disaster impacts on crop insurance), while machine learning (e.g., random forests) enhances personalized risk predictions through training on multi-source data (demographics, telematics). The synergy of CLT and LLN strengthens capital allocation and solvency frameworks, offering a robust mathematical foundation for sustainable, data-driven risk governance. By integrating classical theory with modern techniques like high-dimensional Copula models and reinforcement learning, this study advances dynamic premium adjustments, real-time capital optimization, and compliance strategies.

Using case studies from major healthcare initiatives in West Africa, the research explores both successful and failed projects to draw lessons on effective governance structures, financial management practices, and regulatory adherence. A comparative analysis with other emerging regions, such as South Asia and Latin America, further provides insights into best practices that can be adapted to strengthen healthcare project governance in West Africa. The findings reveal that while regulatory fragmentation and inadequate enforcement mechanisms remain key obstacles, emerging opportunities exist in digital health innovations, AI-driven risk analysis, and blockchain technology for compliance tracking. The paper concludes with actionable recommendations for governments, healthcare institutions, and project managers to enhance risk management and compliance in healthcare projects. These include strengthening regulatory harmonization across the region, increasing investment in healthcare financing, leveraging technology for risk assessment and compliance monitoring, and addressing human resource gaps through targeted capacity-building initiatives. By adopting these strategies, West Africa can improve healthcare project success rates, ensure better regulatory compliance, and ultimately enhance healthcare delivery for its growing population.",HIV/AIDS Impact and Responses; Public-Private Partnership Projects

Rethinking radon Risk: Scientific advances and regulatory implications (since 1990s),2025-04-28,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2025.107707,review,0,Journal of Environmental Radioactivity,Robert Bobkier; Konstantin Kovler; Andrey Tsapalov; Ewa Katarzyna Czech,,True,hybrid,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvrad.2025.107707,"This study examines the global evolution of scientific understanding regarding radon exposure and its health implications, focusing on the transition from early occupational exposure limits and epidemiological risk assessments to molecular-level attributions of radon-induced diseases. Since the early 1990s, advancements in genetic and molecular research have provided growing evidence suggesting that radon exposure may leave a distinct oncological signature, potentially allowing for more precise differentiation between radon-induced lung cancers and those caused by other factors. While this field continues to evolve, its implications extend beyond epidemiological risk assessment to include legal, medical, and regulatory frameworks. Beyond lung cancer, contemporary research has explored links between radon exposure and a range of other oncological and non-oncological diseases, including leukemia, kidney cancer, neurodegenerative disorders, and chronic respiratory conditions. The study further explores the ethical and legal consequences of these findings, particularly in the context of risk governance, compensation claims, and occupational health regulations. The paper also examines the hybrid nature of radon as both naturally occurring and anthropogenically intensified hazard, complicating risk perception and public policy responses. Additionally, the phenomenon of ""contaminated communities,"" is discussed, wherein prolonged radon exposure disrupts social structures and contributes to psychological distress, economic losses, and legal disputes. By analyzing radon exposure through the lens of toxic disaster theory, this study outlines the sequential stages of public and regulatory responses, from initial scientific uncertainty to regulatory intervention and societal adaptation. The findings highlight a broader challenge in environmental health governance: how scientific advancements are integrated into public health policies amid economic and political constraints. Ultimately, the study underscores the need for continuous scientific inquiry and proactive policymaking to address the full spectrum of health risks associated with radon exposure.",Radioactivity and Radon Measurements; Radioactive contamination and transfer; Nuclear and radioactivity studies

These are extracted using the Nelson–Siegel model, which effectively captures the three dimensions of the yield curve. To forecast the factors, we applied autoregressive (AR) and vector autoregressive (VAR) models. Using their forecasts, we predict the returns of government and corporate bonds, equities, REITs, and commodity futures. Our predictions were compared against two benchmarks: the historical mean, and an AR(1) model based on past returns. We employed the Diebold–Mariano test and the Model Confidence Set procedure to assess the comparative forecast accuracy. We found that Nelson–Siegel factors had significant predictive power for one-month-ahead returns of bonds, equities, and REITs, but not for commodity futures. However, for 6-month and 12-month-ahead forecasts, neither the AR(1) nor VAR(1) models based on Nelson–Siegel factors outperformed the benchmarks. These results suggest that the Nelson–Siegel factors affect the aggregate stochastic discount factor for pricing all assets traded in the US economy.",Stochastic processes and financial applications; Financial Risk and Volatility Modeling; Complex Systems and Time Series Analysis

The analysis integrates financial asset pricing, ESG risk, cultural context, and technological adoption. Expanding the Fama-French framework, a hybrid model was estimated. Specification tests, including a significant Hausman test (χ2 = 32.1, p&amp;lt;0.01), supported the use of the Entity Fixed Effects model to control for firm-specific unobserved heterogeneity. Results indicate that standard Fama-French factors are significant predictors of excess returns. The direct impact of the aggregate ESG risk score was not statistically significant in the preferred model (p=0.12). However, a significant interaction in the pooled analysis (p = 0.05) suggests that improving ESG performance from a low risk level is associated with greater excess returns. While cultural distance and an AI adoption proxy were included, their direct or moderating effects on excess returns were not statistically robust in the preferred model. The findings emphasize that while systematic risks drive e-commerce financial performance, strategic ESG improvement, particularly from a lower baseline, may offer tangible financial benefits.",Economic Growth and Development

We measure firms’ organization capital by accumulated selling, general and administrative expenses, and we additionally consider an alternative measure based on the accumulated expenses on wages and R&amp;D activities. When forming quintile portfolios based on the ratio of organization capital to total assets (OA), we find that the highest quintile OA portfolio earns higher mean and risk-adjusted returns than the lowest quintile OA portfolio, consistent with the previous finding in the US stock market. More importantly, the positive OA–return relation is stronger for the OA measure based on wages and R&amp;D activities, both of which are closely related to human capital. Finally, we find that while high-OA firms are less exposed to market risk than low-OA firms, the former are more negatively exposed to technology shocks than the latter. This result suggests that a technology shock—a systematic risk distinguished from the market risk—is the driving factor for the positive relation between OA and stock returns. Furthermore, our results imply that a technology shock can play a significant role in asset pricing in the Korean stock market.",Corporate Finance and Governance

This study aims to conduct a climate risk assessment for compound disaster events of hot-drought and hot-humid and employ an atmospheric reanalysis dataset (ERA5) to obtain precipitation, temperature, and humidity across 16 cities in Shandong Province, China. The findings revealed that between 1979 and 2019, the frequency of hot and drought compound events fluctuated, whereas the occurrence of hot and humid compound events displayed a significant increasing trend. Specifically, the frequency of hot and humid compound events across Shandong Province from 2010 to 2019 was 77% higher than that observed from 1979 to 1989. We identified 12 vulnerability, exposure, and capacity indicators, including two compound hazard events. Using the CRA framework, this study applied the entropy method to evaluate the weight factors of the indicators in risk assessment, enabling a systematic risk assessment of summer compound events in the region.

Deoxynivalenol (DON), which is a toxic secondary metabolite produced by Fusarium fungi, can lead to multiple harmful effects in humans and animals, such as hepatotoxicity, nephrotoxicity, immunotoxicity, gastrointestinal toxicity, neurotoxicity, genetic toxicity and carcinogenicity. Recently, there has been growing concern about DON-induced male infertility. Exposure to DON and its metabolites can damage the structure and function of male reproductive organs, resulting in impairment of gametogenesis and thus impaired fertility. Potential molecular mechanisms involve oxidative stress, inflammatory response, mitochondrial dysfunction, apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, pyroptosis, and ferroptosis. Moreover, several signaling pathways, including nuclear factor-kappa B, mitogen-activated protein kinase, NLR family pyrin domain containing 3, nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, AMP-activated protein kinase, mitochondrial apoptotic pathways, and microRNAs are involved in these detrimental biological processes. Research has shown that several antioxidants, small-molecule inhibitors, or proteins (such as lactoferrin) supplementation can potentially offer protective effects by targeting these signaling pathways. This review comprehensively summarizes the harmful effects of DON exposure on male reproductive function in mammals, the underlying molecular mechanisms and emphasizes the potential of several small molecules as protective therapeutics. In the further, the systematic risk assessment when DON at environmental exposure doses to human reproductive health, the in-depth and precise molecular mechanism investigation using emerging technologies, and the development of more effective intervention strategies warrant urgent investigation.","Mycotoxins in Agriculture and Food; Carcinogens and Genotoxicity Assessment; Genomics, phytochemicals, and oxidative stress"

Purpose This study estimates the effect of international sovereign bond spreads (systematic risk) and debt‐side governance (unsystematic risk) on cross‐border infrastructure risk premiums in Kenya's major infrastructure projects from 2011 to 2020. Approach and methods We use pooled and random‐effects panel data analysis of secondary data. Findings The findings show that rising international sovereign bond spreads (ranging from 9.6% to 32.39%), corruption levels, external debt‐to‐import ratios, loan utilization rates, disbursement delays, and climate risk disclosure significantly contributed to increasing cross‐border infrastructure risk premiums. The interaction between bond spreads and corruption had a compounding effect in increasing cross‐border infrastructure risk premiums. On the other hand, longer loan maturities, higher internal rates of return, substantial government involvement, and a rising external debt to total investment ratio reduce project risk premiums. Policy implications These findings underscore the need for Kenya's modern Public Debt Management Office and infrastructure execution institutions to reduce external borrowing costs through governance reforms that improve transparency, project oversight, and environmental standards. By strengthening debt‐side governance, Kenya can reduce its external borrowing costs and improve the sustainability of infrastructure‐led debt. As such, the study offers actionable insights for low‐ and middle‐income countries, emphasizing the role of modern sovereign debt management tools that target sustainability and strategic governance reforms at the project level in attracting more favourable borrowing rates for infrastructure financing.",Credit Risk and Financial Regulations; Public-Private Partnership Projects; State Capitalism and Financial Governance

This review employs the Discounted cash-flow (DCF) model to examine financial economics-based research on ESG factors, focusing on their impact on corporate performance through the lenses of cash-flow, idiosyncratic and downside risk, as well as systematic risk channels. The literature reveals four key mechanisms through which ESG characteristics in- fluence CFP, mapped within the numerator (cash-flow) and denominator (discount rate) com- ponents of the DCF framework. The link between ESG and cash-flow is examined through analyses of corporate ESG attributes and various financial profitability indicators. Firms with strong ESG performance demonstrate enhanced control over idiosyncratic risk via the cash- flow transmission channel. Additionally, the ESG–cost-of-capital link highlights how reduced systematic and downside risks contribute to improved financial performance. The reported results consistently point to a positive relationship between ESG performance and financial outcomes. This review underscores how ESG strategies not only signal financial strength but also promote alignment with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In particular, improved ESG performance supports SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth) by fostering resilient, long-term business models; SDG 12 (Responsible Consumption and Pro- duction) through corporate accountability; and SDG 13 (Climate Action) via environmental risk mitigation. These findings highlight ESG’s role as both a financial and sustainability lever, offering insights with far-reaching implications for policymakers, investors, and global sustainability partnerships (SDG 17).",Private Equity and Venture Capital; Sustainable Finance and Green Bonds; Corporate Finance and Governance

However, challenges like undefined yield optimization, insufficient risk management, and limited process analytical technology (PAT) integration hinder its industrial application. This study aimed to develop a proof-of-concept HME platform for CCs, assess process risks, and evaluate PAT-enabled monitoring to facilitate robust production. Methods: Using carbamazepine (CBZ) and nicotinamide (NIC) as model compounds, an HME platform compatible with PAT tools was established. A systematic risk assessment identified five key risk domains: materials, machinery, measurement, methods, and other factors. A Box–Behnken design of experiments (DoE) evaluated the impact of screw speed, temperature, and mixing sections on CC quality. Near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy monitored CBZ-NIC co-crystal formation in real time during HME process. Results: DoE revealed temperature and number of mixing sections significantly influenced particle size (D50: 2.0–4.0 μm), while screw speed affected efficiency. NIR spectroscopy detected a unique CC absorption peak at 5008.3 cm⁻¹, enabling real-time structural monitoring with high accuracy (R² = 0.9999). Risk assessment highlighted material attributes, process parameters, and equipment design as critical factors affecting CC formation. All experimental batches yielded ≥ 94% pure CCs with no residual starting materials, demonstrating process reproducibility and robustness. Conclusions: Overall, this work successfully established a continuous hot-melt extrusion (HME) process for manufacturing CBZ-NIC co-crystals, offering critical insights into material, equipment, and process parameters while implementing robust in-line NIR monitoring for real-time quality control.

This study evaluates the adequacy of existing risk management programs for aging dams in developing countries, with a focus on the Mindu Dam in Morogoro Municipality, Tanzania. Specifically, the study aims (1) to establish a global dam safety policy benchmark, (2) assess the rules and policies in place that govern dam safety, and (3) examine the compliance with and variation from dam safety guidelines. A prime example of neglected ageing infrastructure is Mindu Dam, a small, publicly owned project built between 1978 to1985 and official opened on 9th may 1985 for municipal water supply irrigation and Due to its deteriorating state, antiquated design guidelines, and close proximity to heavily populated areas, it has been designated as a ""high-risk"" dam. The study's methodology combines both quantitative and qualitative techniques: criteria for ""minimum"" to ""best"" standards are informed by a global policy evaluation of dam safety frameworks, such as World Bank guidelines. Field surveys, soil erosion evaluations, vegetation observation, through field inspections which were carried out for Mindu in 2023. Technical data was augmented by structured interviews with 45 stakeholders, including local residents and dam operators. The findings indicate systemic deficiencies, 80% of respondents identify that a reservoir perimeter experiences erosion from encroaching agricultural, 40% report that spillway capacity is below current flood projections, and 100% state that dam outlets show advanced corrosion. Because they lack regular monitoring and emergency response plans, risk management procedures fall short of even ""minimum"" criteria. The report incorporates World Bank recommendations into a tiered policy framework, giving institutional changes like required inspections for private dams and urgent repairs like outlet replacement priority. For ageing dams, this study emphasizes the need to switch from informal management to systematic risk-based methods. It offers policymakers in developing nations a repeatable model for addressing governance inadequacies in infrastructure by striking a balance between socioeconomic viability and technical rigor.",Dam Engineering and Safety; Landslides and related hazards

The increasing use of autonomous robots in personal care, particularly for elderly individuals, presents significant safety concerns. Although these robots are designed to assist users in daily activities, they pose risks such as mechanical injuries, electrical malfunctions, and privacy violations. Additionally, ethical concerns regarding user dependency and psychological effects are becoming increasingly relevant. The research categorizes personal care robots into three groups: mobile servant robots, transportation robots, and physical assistant robots. A comprehensive analysis of accidents involving these robots has identified the most common hazards, including sensor malfunctions, unexpected movements, and collisions. Additionally, the study evaluates existing risk assessment methodologies, such as Model-Based Safety Engineering (MBSE), Model-Based Safety Analysis (MBSA), and fuzzy inference systems based on ISO 13482 safety standards. A systematic risk assessment method was developed, incorporating checklists, surveys, and a risk matrix to quantify hazard levels. The evaluation of three specific robots—Lio (a mobile assistant with a robotic arm), iARM (a robotic arm mounted on a wheelchair), and KAIST (a wearable exoskeleton robot)—demonstrated varying levels of risk, with significant dangers associated with mechanical force, power failures, and unintentional shutdowns. Special attention was given to risks associated with prolonged human-robot interactions, including potential psychological stress and ethical dilemmas regarding autonomy and decision-making in caregiving environments. Findings indicate that while some risks can be mitigated through design improvements, others require enhanced user awareness and regulatory measures. Key recommendations include improving sensor reliability, implementing emergency stop mechanisms, and enhancing user training programs. Additionally, manufacturers should incorporate advanced human-detection algorithms and collision avoidance technologies to minimize physical harm. Furthermore, ethical considerations, including the psychological impact of robot interactions and data security, are discussed in-depth, highlighting the need for strict guidelines in robot deployment. In conclusion, this study underscores the necessity of integrating robust safety measures into personal care robotics to prevent accidents and ensure user well-being. Future research should focus on refining risk assessment models, improving human-robot interaction protocols, and advancing safety regulations for personal care robots. The continuous evaluation and adaptation of safety protocols will be crucial in addressing emerging risks and ensuring the widespread acceptance of these robots in healthcare and personal assistance sectors.",Social Robot Interaction and HRI; Human-Automation Interaction and Safety; Robot Manipulation and Learning

Theoretical Framework: Risk analysis is an activity related to Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA). However, this analysis can be conducted independently. The Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA), also known as the Breakage Types and Consequences Analysis, is a systematic risk analysis tool used to identify, prioritize, and mitigate potential failure modes in products, processes, or systems. In this study, FMEA is employed to determine whether the final quality of the water distributed to consumers meets the legally established standards. Method: The methodology adopted for this research includes the collection and analysis of water samples from two points within five different educational institutions. Water monitoring was conducted once per month between March and November 2023. The parameters evaluated were turbidity, apparent color, pH, free residual chlorine (FRC), total coliforms, and E. coli. In defining the potential failures listed in the FMEA form, four physicochemical and two microbiological parameters were considered. To assess the representativeness of the listed hazards and quantify them, scores/indices for severity (S), occurrence (O), detection (D), and risk scope (A) were established. Finally, the risk (R) was calculated, and the hazards were ranked accordingly. Results and Discussion: The risk assessment results indicate that the most urgent corrective measures should focus on the educational institutions (EIs) receiving water from Individual Alternative Solutions (IAS) with inadequate and unprotected storage conditions, as these facilities impact water quality maintenance. The failure mode requiring priority attention pertains to the presence of total coliforms and E. coli. Microbiological contamination is even more concerning because the water in all five educational institutions lacks substances that impart taste, such as iron, making it appear potable and suitable for consumption. This is significant, as people often rely on their senses of smell, taste, and sight when selecting water for consumption. Research Implications: In practical terms, monitoring the water quality in educational institutions and utilizing FMEA has proven to be an important tool in identifying the most concerning health hazards. This approach has the potential to support educational and municipal managers in making informed decisions regarding collective and alternative water systems, as well as in ensuring proper care for building reservoirs. Originality/Value: his study contributes to the literature by demonstrating the feasibility of applying FMEA as an instrument for immediate corrective decision-making in educational institutions. The challenges faced by smaller municipalities or those more remote from major urban centers in monitoring water quality at locations with high population densities highlight the need for collaboration across various societal sectors to establish a health risk management plan.",Healthcare Regulation; Healthcare during COVID-19 Pandemic; Health Education and Validation
